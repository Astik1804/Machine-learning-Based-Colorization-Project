# Machine-learning-Based-Colorization-Project
A Machine learning-based colorization project uses deep learning models to convert grayscale images into color. It typically employs convolutional neural networks, autoencoders, or generative adversarial networks trained on large datasets of colored images. The final system can be deployed as a web application or API for real-time colorization.
